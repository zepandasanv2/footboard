# Football Club Dashboard âš½ðŸ“Š

## Description
This project is a **Football Club Dashboard** built using **Power BI** to analyze and visualize match statistics and player performance. The data is sourced from multiple inputs, primarily a **relational database**, and processed through **Python ETL scripts** to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Features
- **Player Performance Analysis:** Track goals, assists, minutes played, and other key metrics.
- **Match Statistics:** View team performances, possession percentages, shots, passes, and more.
- **Automated ETL Pipeline:** Python scripts extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources into a structured database.
- **Database-Driven Insights:** The dashboard is powered by a relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) with optimized data structures.
- **Power BI Visualizations:** Interactive charts, tables, and KPIs to gain deeper insights into club and player performance.

## Technology Stack
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization)
- **Python** (ETL - Pandas, SQLAlchemy, API handling)
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** (Database Management)
- **GitHub** (Version Control)
